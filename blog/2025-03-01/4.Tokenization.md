# Introduction

In building LLMs, the first step is to obtain the input text and pass it through the Tokenizer

<!-- truncate -->

# Tokenizer

Steps in Tokenization is as follows

## Types of Tokenizer

Below are three type of Tokenizers available.

## Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)

:::note
- Orginally BPE was developed as a compression algorithm.  

- Checkout more details and the example used from [**Wiki**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding)

## Modified BPE

:::tip
In LLM, we use something called **`Modified Byte Pair Encoding`**. Used for encoding plain text to tokens
